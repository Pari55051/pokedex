# Pokedex
Pokedex web-app using the PokeAPI.

Some days ago, I made a project named "Who's That Pokemon" (You can check it out on my github, link is also provided below). From which I found out about many new Pokemons. This made me curious about exploring Pokemons, thus I made it to learn about more Pokemons.
